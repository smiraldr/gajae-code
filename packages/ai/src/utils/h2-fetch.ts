/**
 * Patch `globalThis.fetch` to advertise HTTP/2 in TLS ALPN, with transparent
 * HTTP/1.1 fallback when the server doesn't negotiate `h2`.
 *
 * Bun's HTTP/2 client is gated on `BUN_FEATURE_FLAG_EXPERIMENTAL_HTTP2_CLIENT`,
 * read by the native runtime before any JS executes; assigning to
 * `process.env` from inside JS is a no-op. Per-request `protocol: "http2"`
 * activates h2 over TLS ALPN and rejects with `error.code === "HTTP2Unsupported"`
 * if the server picks anything else, so we catch and retry without the hint.
 *
 * Some HTTPS endpoints (e.g. corporate API gateways behind reverse proxies)
 * advertise h2 via ALPN but then refuse or reset the connection at the HTTP/2
 * framing layer. Bun surfaces these as `ConnectionRefused`, `ConnectionReset`,
 * `ConnectionClosed`, or `HTTP2StreamReset` rather than `HTTP2Unsupported`, so
 * we treat those codes as h2-fallback triggers as well. `ConnectionRefused` is
 * raised before the request is written, but a reset, a close, or a pre-response
 * RST_STREAM does not prove the peer never consumed the body — it may have
 * processed the request and died before answering. Replaying those three on h1
 * would duplicate the side effect, so `ConnectionReset`, `ConnectionClosed`,
 * and `HTTP2StreamReset` fall back only for requests that are provably
 * replay-safe (replay-safe method AND no body); anything else rethrows the
 * original error.
 *
 * ALPN-refusing hosts (notably zcode.z.ai, the GLM ZCode OAuth broker) abort
 * the TLS handshake entirely when the client offers ALPN h2. Bun reports that
 * abort as `UNKNOWN_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR` even though the host's
 * certificate chain verifies fine over h1 (issue #5178), so that code is a
 * fallback trigger too — never a reason to accept a bad certificate: the h1
 * attempt below performs full verification on its own.
 *
 * Bun negotiates h2 via ALPN over TLS only (no h2c), so plain `http://` URLs
 * skip the attempt entirely — avoids the throw/retry round-trip for localhost.
 *
 * Idempotent.
